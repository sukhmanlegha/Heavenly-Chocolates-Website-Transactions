# Heavenly-Chocolates-Website-Transactions-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing data collected from online transactions to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends on the Heavenly Chocolates website. The dataset (Heavenly-Chocolates-Website-Transactions.csv) contains information about 50 transactions, including the day of the week, type of browser used, time spent on the website, pages viewed, and the amount spent by each customer.

## Project Goals

#### Descriptive Statistics:

* Calculate summary measures (mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range, minimum, and maximum) for each quantitative variable in the dataset.
* Present the results in a table, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset's quantitative characteristics.

#### Relationship Between Pages Viewed and Amount Spent:
* Explore the potential relationship between the number of website pages viewed and the amount spent.
* Justify findings using a visual representation and two numerical measures to offer insights into customer spending patterns.

#### Time Distribution on the Website:
* Visualize the distribution of time spent on the website using a histogram.
* Analyze the skewness of the distribution to understand the patterns of customer engagement.

#### Crosstabulation of Categorical Variables:
* Tabulate joint frequencies of the day of the week and browser type using cross-tabulation.
* Present the frequencies as percentages of row total and percentages of column total in separate tables.
* Extract insights regarding the relationships between these categorical variables and sales.

#### Browser-wise Analysis:
* Generate boxplots for each browser type to summarize the amount spent by customers.
* Identify quartiles and potential outliers for each browser.
* Extract insights into spending patterns based on browser type.
